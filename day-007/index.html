        <h1>Gryposaurus</h1>
        <p class="para">Gryposaurus ("hooked-nosed lizard") is a genus of large, duck-billed hadrosaurid dinosaur that inhabited North America (specifically Canada and the U.S.) about 80 to 75 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. 
            Measuring around 8 to 9 meters in length, this facultative biped is best recognized by a distinctive, high-arched nasal hump—resembling a "Roman nose"—which may have been used for species identification or social display. 
            As a common herbivore preferring river-side environments, it possessed massive dental batteries with hundreds of teeth for grinding tough vegetation.
