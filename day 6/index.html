                <h2>Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>
                <p>HTML is the basic building block of a website. It is used to create the structure of a web page and decide what content appears on the screen. With HTML, we can add headings, paragraphs, images, links, and sections. Without HTML, a web page cannot exist because it gives meaning and structure to the content.</p>

                <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
                <p>CSS is used to design and style a web page. It controls how the HTML elements look, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. With CSS, we can make a website attractive and user-friendly. Without CSS, all web pages would look plain and boring with only black text on a white background.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is used to make a website interactive and dynamic. It allows a web page to respond to user actions like button clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements. JavaScript can change content on the page without reloading it. Without JavaScript, a website would be static and have no interaction.</p>
